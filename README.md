## Quantum Circuit Simulator by Onur İlhan Çoban
This is a simple quantum computer simulator made using C#. It simulates circuits using simple matrix representations of quantum gates, which unfortunately ruins the performance (but i kinda like having more than 4 gates). One of the main things I experimented with is simplifying the circuit creating process by only having one method to add gates, which avoids having tons of methods for each gate combination. I hope this project serves as an inspiration for future quantum developers.

## Notice: This project incomplete as of 20.03.2023.
###  However, you can install MathNet.Numerics and use QuantumCircuit.SV_CALCULATE_DEBUG() to generate a statevector.
